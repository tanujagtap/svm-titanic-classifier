# Titanic Survival Prediction â€“ SVM

This project applies the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster.

## Objective
Build a classifier using SVM that predicts survival (0 or 1) based on key features like age, sex, class, etc.

## Dataset
- Titanic dataset (Kaggle / seaborn)
- Features: Pclass, Sex, Age, Fare, Embarked, etc.

##  Techniques
- Data Cleaning & Imputation
- Feature Encoding
- Train-Test Split
- Support Vector Machine (SVC)
- Accuracy & Confusion Matrix

## Tools
Python, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, seaborn, Jupyter Notebooks
